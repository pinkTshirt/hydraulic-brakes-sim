# 🏎️ Brake Dynamics & Thermal Lab

This is an interactive web app designed to simulate the physics and temperatures of a baja vehicles's braking system 

It helps you visualize how kinetic energy turns into heat across both front and rear brakes in real time.
Also has an added simulation of the brakes circuit

## Core Features

### 1. Settings
Preloaded with real engineering data:
* **Vehicle Weight:** Set to a lightweight $245\text{ kg}$ buggy.
* **Rotational Factor ($k = 1.15$):** Accounts for the extra energy needed to stop spinning parts like wheels and rotors.
* **Brake Bias Setup:** Simulates a realistic $75\%$ front and $25\%$ rear brake balance.
* **Dual Mass Tracking:** Separates the full rotor mass from the actual "rubbing surface" to show both average cooling temps and instant surface hot-spots.

### 2. Live Telemetry Chart
* Powered by **Chart.js**, the graph updates live every 50 milliseconds.
* It simultaneously tracks your **Speed**, **Front Rotor Temperature**, and **Rear Rotor Temperature** without slowing down your browser.

### 3. Integrated Thermal Lab Sheet
Right below the simulation track, a built-in lab workspace calculates your exact spreadsheet formulas instantly:
* **Total Energy ($J$):** Total kinetic energy converted during braking.
* **Power ($W$) & Heat Flux ($\text{W/m}^2$):** Shows exactly how hard the brakes are working and how concentrated the heat is on the rotor surface.
* **Temperature Spikes ($\Delta T$):** Predicts the exact degree jump your rotors will experience from a full stop.

### 4. Simulation
* Circuit simulation of a hydraulic brakes system

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **HTML5 & CSS3:** Clean layout built with a responsive grid and flexbox.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Pure, native code running a fast physics loop without lag or rounding bugs.
* **Chart.js:** Included via a lightweight CDN to handle smooth graphing.
